  <h2>Project Narrative</h2>

  <p>
    The artifact I chose to enhance for the Software Design and Engineering category was
    my CS-330 Computational Graphics and Visualizations 3D scene. This project is an
    OpenGL application written in C++. The original version of the project consisted of
    a simple desktop scene containing a pencil, eraser, piece of paper, and a coffee cup,
    along with a basic lighting system to add visual depth. I completed this project
    during the previous term, and after reflecting on it, I identified several areas
    where it could be expanded and improved, which led me to select it for enhancement
    in this course.
  </p>

  <p>
    This artifact demonstrates my ability to think creatively by visualizing and
    constructing an idea within a three-dimensional space. Projects of this nature
    require significant fine-tuning and adjustment, which highlights my patience and
    persistence throughout the development process. For this enhancement, I transformed
    the original desktop scene into a complete room environment that includes windows,
    a door, a chair, and lighting fixtures. I also improved the lighting system to give
    the scene a more realistic look and feel.
  </p>

  <p>
    I believe that I successfully met the course outcomes selected in Module One by
    improving the organization of my code and adding more comments, which enhanced code
    readability and communication. Additionally, this project demonstrates my ability
    to apply innovative techniques and technical skills to bring a conceptual vision to
    life within a fully realized 3D scene.
  </p>

  <p>
    Overall, the process of enhancing this artifact was both challenging and rewarding.
    I was able to apply the experience and knowledge gained from the original project to
    support further enhancements. The workflow remained similar to the original
    development process, involving the addition of mesh objects, application of
    textures, and adjustments to lighting. One of the greatest challenges was properly
    positioning objects within the scene, particularly when working with dozens of
    interconnected elements. Lighting also presented difficulties, as limitations in
    the lighting system required creative adjustments to achieve a visually appealing
    result. Despite these challenges, the project significantly expanded my
    understanding of 3D design, particularly in creating full-scale scenes that require
    careful coordination of objects, textures, and materials.
