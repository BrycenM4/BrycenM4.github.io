  <h2>Project Narrative</h2>

  <p>
    My second enhancement for this project was done on my CS-360 Mobile Inventory Tracking
    app. This android application is a role-based inventory management system designed to
    help users track, update, and monitor item quantities. It was created earlier this
    year when I was taking the CS-360 Mobile Architect and Programming class. I chose this
    item because I thought the enhancement would demonstrate my ability to improve
    user-experience and security. The specific components that will be showcasing those
    abilities is the addition of role-based access, a search bar, and low-quantity alerts.
  </p>

  <p>
    Implementing role-based access relies heavily on creating and modifying algorithms and
    data structures. For example, this utilizes algorithms through decision-making and
    permissions checking, using things like if-else branches to ensure each type of role
    only has access to their necessary components and features. It utilizes data
    structures by storing roles in the database. The additional search bar also relies on
    algorithms and data structures for things like filtering and query operations. Lastly,
    the low-quantity alerts perform database indexing and linear searching to properly find
    and alert the user of low-quantities in the database.
  </p>

  <p>
    The different roles that are included in this app include owner, administrator, and
    viewer. The owner of the database has access to everything, including
    adding/deleting/modifying items and promoting/demoting users. The administrator role
    has access to adding/deleting/modifying items, as well as only promoting viewers to
    the administrator role. Lastly, the viewers can only view the item list and see
    quantities (can not add/delete/modify items or promote/demote at all). Additionally,
    the low-quantity alerts will send a notification to all roles when an item’s quantity
    drops below five.
  </p>

  <p>
    I believe that I did meet my course outcomes for this enhancement, because I’ll be
    designing solutions for a given problem (no way to filter items), demonstrating my
    ability to use innovative techniques and skills (quantity alerts), and improving
    overall security for the application(role-based access control).
  </p>

  <p>
    Considering that I have limited experience with mobile app development, this was quite
    difficult to complete. The basic functionality I had before wasn’t too detailed or in
    depth, so the code really wasn’t all that complex, but the addition of role-based
    access control in particular was quite difficult. I think that was mainly because I
    had to make certain features invisible to certain roles, while making them visible for
    others, which was a concept I’ve never really encountered in coding before. While it
    was difficult, I still feel like I learned a lot and became a better programmer and
    software designer because of it.
