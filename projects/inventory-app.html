  <h2>Project Narrative</h2>

  <p>
    The second enhancement for this ePortfolio was completed on my CS-360 Mobile Inventory
    Tracking application. This Android application is a role-based inventory management
    system designed to help users track, update, and monitor item quantities. The original
    version of this project was developed earlier this year during the CS-360 Mobile
    Architecture and Programming course. I selected this artifact for enhancement because
    it provided an opportunity to demonstrate improvements in both user experience and
    application security. The primary enhancements include the implementation of
    role-based access control, a search feature, and low-quantity alerts.
  </p>

  <p>
    Implementing role-based access control relies heavily on the use of algorithms and
    data structures. This enhancement required decision-making logic and permission
    checking through conditional statements to ensure that each user role has access only
    to the appropriate features. Data structures were also used to store and manage user
    roles within the application’s database. The added search functionality further
    demonstrates the use of algorithms and data structures by performing filtering and
    query operations. Additionally, the low-quantity alert system utilizes database
    indexing and linear searching to identify items with low stock levels and notify
    users accordingly.
  </p>

  <p>
    The application supports three distinct user roles: owner, administrator, and viewer.
    The owner role has full access to all system features, including adding, deleting, and
    modifying inventory items, as well as promoting or demoting users. The administrator
    role can add, delete, and modify inventory items and promote viewers to administrators.
    The viewer role is limited to viewing the inventory list and item quantities, with no
    permissions to modify data or manage user roles. In addition to these permissions, the
    low-quantity alert feature sends notifications to all user roles when an item’s
    quantity falls below five.
  </p>

  <p>
    I believe that this enhancement successfully met the course outcomes by requiring me
    to design effective solutions for real-world problems, such as the inability to
    efficiently filter inventory items. The project also demonstrates my ability to apply
    innovative techniques, including automated quantity alerts, while improving the
    overall security of the application through role-based access control.
  </p>

  <p>
    Given my limited prior experience with mobile application development, this project
    presented several challenges. While the original application’s functionality was
    relatively simple, the addition of role-based access control significantly increased
    the complexity of the codebase. One of the most difficult aspects was managing feature
    visibility across different user roles, ensuring that certain components were hidden
    or displayed appropriately based on permissions. Despite these challenges, the
    enhancement process was highly educational and contributed to my growth as a
    programmer and software designer.
