  <h2>Project Narrative</h2>

  <p>
    The artifact selected for enhancement in the Databases category was my CS-340 Dashboard
    Project, originally developed during the previous summer term. This project is an
    interactive web-based dashboard built using the Dash framework and a MongoDB database.
    The application was designed for a rescue animal agency and stores records related to
    various types of dogs. The dashboard allows users to search for and visualize records
    within the database. The original version of the project supported only a limited set
    of filtering options based on rescue types, including Water, Mountain and Wilderness,
    and Tracking. For this enhancement, I implemented additional filtering options based on
    age, sex, and breed, along with a search feature for more specific queries. I also
    created and configured a new MongoDB database, as the original database used in CS-340
    was no longer available.
  </p>

  <p>
    I selected this artifact because it provided an opportunity to expand upon its
    database and filtering capabilities, allowing me to demonstrate improvements in user
    interface design, data filtering, and database integration. The addition of advanced
    filtering options and a search bar showcases my ability to implement complex filtering
    logic and algorithms that operate efficiently with a standalone database.
  </p>

  <p>
    I believe that this enhancement successfully met the course outcomes planned in Module
    One by requiring me to design and implement an effective solution for a real-world
    problem. The project demonstrates the use of algorithmic principles and advanced
    computer science practices, as well as my ability to apply modern and innovative
    techniques to improve the overall user experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    Throughout the enhancement process, I gained a deeper understanding of filtering and
    search logic, particularly within an interactive application environment. I also
    expanded my knowledge of database functionality and how web applications utilize
    databases for efficient record lookup and retrieval. One of the most challenging
    aspects of this project was working with the syntax and structure of the Dash framework.
    While the original development in CS-340 involved frequent errors and deployment
    challenges, enhancing the project locally during this course made the process more
    manageable and reinforced my confidence in using Dash and MongoDB together.
