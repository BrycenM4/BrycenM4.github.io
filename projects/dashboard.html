  <h2>Project Narrative</h2>

  <p>
    The artifact I chose to enhance for the Databases category was my CS-340 Dashboard
    Project, which was originally created this past summer. It’s an interactive web
    dashboard run using the dash framework and MongoDB database. This application was
    created for a rescue-animal agency, and as a result, the database holds many records
    related to different types of dogs. The dashboard is meant to help search for and
    visualize the records in the database. The base project only allowed for a few
    filtering options, those being for the different types of rescues the agency
    specialized in (Water, Mountain and Wilderness, and Tracking). With this enhancement,
    I chose to implement additional filtering options for the dataset, including by age,
    sex, and breed, as well as adding a search bar for even more specific lookups. I also
    had to set up my own MongoDB database for this because the one I originally used got
    deleted when I completed the CS-340 class.
  </p>

  <p>
    I chose this item because I knew it had the potential for more advanced filtering and
    database functionality, which would demonstrate my ability to improve UI, data
    filtering, and database integration. More specifically, the additional filtering
    options and search bar showed that I’m capable of implementing advanced filtering
    logic and algorithms, that work seamlessly through a standalone database.
  </p>

  <p>
    I believe that I did meet the course outcomes that I planned for in module one,
    because I designed and implemented a solution for a given problem that utilized
    algorithmic principles and advanced computer science practices, as well as
    demonstrated my ability to use innovative and modern techniques to improve the
    user-experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    Throughout this enhancement, I learned a lot about filtering and search logic,
    especially when used in an interactive environment such as this. I also learned more
    about database functionality and how web-pages utilize them for record lookup
    purposes. The hardest part with this was probably figuring out the syntax and format
    of the dash framework. When I originally created this in CS-340, I had a lot of trouble
    with errors and getting it to run, but this time around was a little bit easier
    because I ran it on my local computer instead of a server like we did then.
