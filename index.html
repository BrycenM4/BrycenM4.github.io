  <h2>Professional Assessment</h2>

  <p>
    Completing coursework throughout the SNHU computer science program and developing an
    ePortfolio significantly strengthened my technical abilities, professional identity,
    and overall employability. This program provided me with the foundations and hands-on
    experience necessary to contribute to real-world software development projects.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through progressive modules and increasingly complex assignments, I developed skills
    in software design, development, testing, and security that are essential to modern
    technology environments. I began by learning the fundamentals of programming using
    Python, including understanding basic syntax, logic, and the history of programming
    languages. An early project involved developing a basic text-based video game in Python,
    consisting of approximately 100 lines of code, which demonstrated the potential of
    continued practice and improvement.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the program progressed, I expanded my technical skill set by working with more
    advanced languages such as C++ and Java, while emphasizing the importance of writing
    organized, maintainable, and secure code. One notable project involved creating unit
    tests for a Java application, which introduced me to quality assurance practices and
    taught me how to verify functionality and identify defects early in the development
    lifecycle. Later coursework included advanced projects such as an Android mobile
    application, a 3D OpenGL scene, and a fully functional web-based dashboard, strengthening
    my understanding of mobile development, computer graphics, and web technologies.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to technical development, the program emphasized core professional concepts
    such as collaboration and communication. Software systems are complex and require
    diverse perspectives and skill sets to develop effectively. Team-based projects helped
    improve my problem-solving abilities, communication skills, and overall collaboration
    experience. The program also reinforced key principles of software engineering, data
    structures and algorithms, and security, all of which are critical for building scalable,
    efficient, and trustworthy applications.
  </p>

  <p>
    This ePortfolio showcases several enhanced projects completed during the CS-499 course.
    These projects demonstrate my growth as a computer science professional by expanding on
    earlier coursework. One featured project is a 3D OpenGL scene originally developed in
    CS-330 Computational Graphics and Visualization and later enhanced in CS-499. The updated
    version expanded a simple desk scene into a full office environment, improving my
    understanding of 3D design, scene composition, and performance considerations.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another highlighted project is a mobile inventory tracking application originally
    developed in CS-360 Mobile Architecture and Programming. Enhancements included role-based
    access control, a search feature, and low-quantity alerts, strengthening my ability to
    design conditional logic, optimize data structures, and meet real-world business
    requirements.
  </p>

  <p>
    The final project featured is a web-based dashboard created using the Dash framework
    and MongoDB, originally developed in CS-340 Client-Server Development and later improved
    in CS-499. Enhancements included additional filtering options and an improved user
    interface, further developing my skills in database integration, user experience design,
    and data visualization.
  </p>

  <p>
    In conclusion, completing the computer science program and developing this ePortfolio
    demonstrates my technical abilities, personal growth, and professional readiness. By
    enhancing projects from earlier coursework, I applied advanced concepts in realistic
    scenarios that reflect my development as a computer science professional and prepare me
    for a career in the technology industry.
