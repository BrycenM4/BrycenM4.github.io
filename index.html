  <h2>Professional Assessment</h2>

  <p>
    Completing coursework throughout the SNHU computer science program and developing an
    ePorfolio significantly strengthened my technical abilities, professional identity,
    and overall employability. This program provided me with the foundations and hands-on
    experience necessary to contribute to real-world software development projects.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through progressive modules and increasingly complex assignments, I developed the
    skills in software design, development, testing, and security that are essential to
    modern tech environments. For example, I first had to learn about the fundamentals of
    programming by learning how to write and understand basic code using Python, as well as
    understanding the history of programming and how it has evolved over time. An example
    of an earlier project I worked on included writing code for a basic text-based
    videogame. The program itself was written in Python and was only about 100 lines in
    total, but it showed me a glimpse of what was possible if I kept on practicing and
    improving. Following that, I started diving into more advanced programs and languages
    such as C++ and Java, while also making sure I understood the importance of writing
    organized, maintainable, and secure code. Another example of a project I worked on
    involved writing unit tests for a Java application. This was the first encounter I
    really had when it came to quality assurance and testing, and it taught me how to
    verify that my application was working as expected, and also how to identify defects
    early on in the development process. Later on in the program, I started working on
    more advanced projects such as an android mobile app, a 3D OpenGL scene, and a fully
    functional web dashboard, which taught me concepts such as mobile development, 3D
    visualizations, and web development.
  </p>

  <p>
    Along with technical development, the program also emphasized several core concepts
    essential to professional software development. One of the most important of those
    was collaboration within a team environment. Software systems are highly complex and
    require different skillsets and perspectives in order to be developed effectively.
    Team collaboration can enhance skills like problem solving, personal growth, and
    overall communication. Effective communication is also another one of the concepts
    emphasized throughout this program and is especially important when it comes to
    communicating with stakeholders in order to ensure that requirements, goals, and user
    needs are understood and met throughout the development process. This program also
    reinforced the importance of concepts such as software engineering, data structures
    and algorithms, and security. Software engineering principles taught me how to design,
    test, and implement software in a way that is scalable and maintainable. Researching
    data structures and algorithms also taught me how to develop efficient solutions by
    optimizing performance and scalability. Lastly, this program emphasized the importance
    of security in order to build secure software applications that are trustworthy and
    reliable in real-world environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    Next, I’d like to showcase some of the projects that I recently worked on as part of
    the CS-499 course. Throughout this course, I enhanced several projects originally
    developed in earlier courses to demonstrate my growth as a computer science
    professional. The first project I want to highlight is a 3D OpenGL scene which I
    mentioned earlier, that I originally made in my CS-330 Computational Graphics and
    Visualizations course, and was later improved upon and enhanced in my CS-499 course.
    It’s a 3D scene made entirely in C++ using the OpenGL framework. The original 3D scene
    for this project only contained a desk with a piece of paper, a pencil, an eraser, and
    cup of coffee on top of it. The new and improved version of this expanded the scene
    into a full-scale office with walls, a ceiling, a floor, a door, a chair, and even
    windows. Through this process, I improved my understanding of 3D design, scene
    composition, and performance consideration.
  </p>

  <p>
    The second project I want to highlight is my mobile inventory tracking app, originally
    developed in the CS-360 Mobile Architecture and Programming course and also enhanced in
    CS-499. The original app allows the user to set up their own inventory database, add
    and remove items, and adjust item quantities. The new version of this included some
    new features, including role-based access control for security purposes, a search bar
    for searching items by name, and low-quantity alerts for improved item tracking. This
    process strengthened my ability to design conditional logic, optimize data structures,
    and adapt to real-world business requirements.
  </p>

  <p>
    The final project I want to highlight is my web-based dashboard project, originally
    made in my CS-340 Client-Server Development course, and was once again improved upon in
    CS-499. This is a web-based dashboard that utilizes the Dash framework and MongoDB in
    order to display an interactive UI for data tracking. The original version of this was
    a simple dashboard that allowed you to search for certain records using a few
    different filtering options and also displayed a pie chart and interactive map to
    better visualize the records in the database. The new version of this now contains
    additional filtering options as well as an improved UI for better user experience.
    This enhancement improved my skills in database integration, UI design, and data
    visualization.
  </p>

  <p>
    In conclusion, the completion of this computer science program and the development of
    this ePortfolio provide a demonstration of my technical abilities, personal growth,
    and professional readiness. By enhancing projects from earlier coursework, I was able
    to apply advanced concepts in more complex and realistic ways for the purpose of
    demonstrating my growth and development as a computer science professional. Overall,
    the work in this ePortfolio reflect my professional skills and abilities that will
    help prepare me for a career in the tech industry.
